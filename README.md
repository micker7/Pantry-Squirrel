Welcome to Pantry Squirrel. Let’s say you’re going to make dinner one night. You look into the pantry and you have a lot of ingredients. You just don’t know what any of them are and how to use them. That’s where we come in at Pantry Squirrel. You put your random ingredients on our website and it tells you all sorts of the types of recipes you can make.

Our goal with this project was to simplify the process of finding new recipes using the ingredients people already have on hand. To achieve this, we needed access to a robust API that could provide us with the necessary information.

API stands for application programming interface. In simple terms, it’s a way for two or more applications to communicate with each other. After some research, we discovered Edamam, an API that offers a wealth of nutrition data and analytics, including over 2.3 million recipes, nearly 1 million food items, and various diets and allergens.

One of our key features was an ingredient input field that would return recipes containing the specified items. Additionally, we developed a browse and search feature to enable users to find recipes that caught their interest.

Here's more features of our product in more detail.

Let's start with the home page. We focused on keeping our UI very simple and intuitive.Here you can simply type in the food items you have and even specify any dietary restrictions, such as Gluten free, for one of your guests. Then, with just a click of a button, Pantry Squirrel returns a list of recipes that match your criteria.

But it doesn't stop there! As we dig deeper into these recipes, Pantry Squirrel provides a link to the instructions, an interactive shopping list, and even a few nutritional facts for each recipe. Alternatively, if you already know the type of recipe you want to make, Pantry Squirrel also offers a search functionality that provides the same comprehensive features.

You see, anyone can make a shopping list on a piece of paper, but Pantry Squirrel goes beyond that by empowering our users to be efficient and resourceful with what's already in their kitchen. Pantry Squirrel unlocks the full potential of their pantry, making cooking at home a breeze.

Let's talk about the programming tools we used for this website.

For the back-end development, we utilized the programming language called C# to manipulate data from the public API that Ibraheem mentioned that’s called Edamam. For our front-end development, we used the language JavaScript to manipulate the users’ input information, to send to C# on the backend. We also used HTML razor pages and CSS to style the website, while using the MVC format to ensure a seamless user experience.

To ensure efficient workflow and organization, we implemented a scrum board on GitHub. This helped us manage tasks on a daily basis and set achievable goals for each day. To avoid merging conflicts, we followed a process where we combined our fresh work for the day into two separate files for front-end and back-end development, and then merged those two branches. We found this way was the best way to avoid merge conflicts, since multiple people were having to work in the same area of the program.

We are excited to implement more features to this website to make it even more useful and enjoyable for the user. We have the ability to have anyone create an account and register with their email. We are excited to implement features for the user to favorite and save recipes they especially like, as well as have the opportunity to save their list of ingredients they have created, that way they do not have to type out a list each time.

We hope you enjoy Pantry Squirrel and find it useful!
